  "readme": "# LokiJS\n\n## Overview\n\nLokiJS is a document oriented client side database written in javascript.\nIts purpose is to store JSON documents in a mongodb fashion (the API is similar but not strictly compliant) and retrieve them with a similar mechanism.\nRuns in node and the browser.\nLokiJS is ideal for the following scenarios: \n\n1. where a lightweight in-memory db is ideal\n2. data sets are not so large that it wouldn't be a problem loading the entire db from a server and synchronising at the end of the work session\n3. cross-platform mobile apps where you can leverage the power of javascript and avoid interacting with native databases\n\nLokiJS has limited supports for indexing, transactions, couchdb-style views.\n\nexample usage [here](https://github.com/techfort/LokiJS/wiki)\n\n## Roadmap\n\nIn the near future mongodb-style dbRef will be implemented, wider and more specific support for indexes such as unique, compound.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2013, Joe Minichino <joe.minichino@gmail.com>\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.
